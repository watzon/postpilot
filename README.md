## About

PostPilot is a developer tool inspired by Laravel Herd's mail panel, designed to simplify email testing during development. It provides a local SMTP server that captures outgoing emails and displays them in a modern, user-friendly interface.

## Features

### Current
- üì¨ Local SMTP server for email testing
- üé® Modern, responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS
- üåì Light/Dark mode support
- üì± Preview emails in different formats (HTML, Text, Raw)
- üîç Basic search capabilities

### Installation

If you're on Linux or Windows you can go check out the [releases page](https://github.com/watzon/postpilot/releases) and download the binary for your platform. As I don't yet have a Windows signing certificate, Windows users will have to skip past the scary "This software may harm your computer" warning, or build from source using the below instructions.

Arch users can install PostPilot from the AUR:

```bash
yay -S postpilot-bin
```

Distro packaging is sparse right now, but you can help with that!
